    Armaan Allidina<br> The concept was to explore the elements I chose thus my art direction became 
    random as that is what I thought I could use best when I created this site. The content chosen where 
    some pictures I made for the site in order to show the shapes function and filter function, 
    in continuing this randomness I chose to use code I made for previous classes that was slightly modified 
    to took in order to help show off the shapes function even further. The colors where also chosen randomly 
    as the first 7 were done in the CSS color spaces with the 8th being a mixed color, the 9th I used cyan with 
    the 1st image created with a background blend as I thought that was the same a mix blend. For the SVG I chose 
    colors at random after adding it to the site. For the squares I chose the two that did not transform to be red 
    and the on that did green. For the circles I chose brown, green and blue. <br>elements: 1:SVGs, 2:nth-child 
    selectors, 3:2D transforms, 4:3D transforms, 5:CSS color spaces (REC2020, P3, XYZ, LAB, OKLAB, LCH and OKLCH), 
    6:CSS Shapes, 7:mix-blend-mode, 8:filter, 9:perspective, 10:color-mix, 11:columns<br><br><br><br><a href="index.html">back</a>
